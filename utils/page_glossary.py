        *Computational Thinking:*
        - Thinking about and framing problems and solutions in a way that would also allow a computer to execute them.
        - How computing principles can by used to understand and analyse both natural and artificial processes.

        *Conditional Execution:*
        - One of the few basic instructions that appear in every programming language
        - Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.

        *Float:*
        - A type 
        - Short for floating-point number
        - Includes floating-point numbers, otherwise known as decimal numbers, such as 46.8, 497.3, and 9,0. 

        *Formal languages:*
        - Designed for specific applications
        - Examples: Programming languages or notation in mathematics
        - For instance, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols

        *Functions:*
        - Can be thought of as little machines, which you can put something into. Then, they manipulate the input in some way, and, maybe, returns an output.
        - Examples introduced in this course: Print() and type().

        *Input:*
        - One of the few basic instructions that appear in every programming language
        - Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some oher device

        *Int:*
        - A type 
        - Short for integer
        - Includes integers (i.e., numbers with no decimals), such as 4, 7, and 34567.

        *Math:*
        - One of the few basic instructions that appear in every programming language
        - Perform besic mathematical operations, like addition and multiplication

        *Natural languages:*
        - The languages people speak, such as English and Danish
        - These languages developed naturally

        *Output:*
        - One of the few basic instructions that appear in every programming language
        - Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc.

        *Print() function:*
        - used to display messages on the screen
        - It is called by giving the name of the function, print, followed by a pair of parentheses (brackets) which contain the parameters you want to pass to it.
        - When you use the print function, the parameter you write inside the brackets are the input; it is what you put into the function.
        - The output is the printed text. 

        *Python:*
        - A programming language 
        - A general-purpose language well-suited for many applications, with simple and naturalistic syntax (i.e., "grammar")
        - It is considered easy to use and appropriate for introductory programming
        - Python is free and open source, which means that new modules and functionalities are continuously developed and released.

        Repetition:
        - One of the few basic instructions that appear in every programming language
        - Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation

        *Script:*
        - A document full of lines of code 
        - Each script is designed to carry out a job, just like a recipe. 
        - All steps are important and must be written out specifically - and in the right order. 

        *Str:*
        - A type
        - Short for string
        - Includes everything in quotation marks, such as ‚Äúhello world!‚Äù, ‚Äú43‚Äù and ‚Äú8.3‚Äù. 

        *Syntax:*
        - The ‚Äùgrammar‚Äù of a programming language

        *Type() function:*
        - Use the type function, when you are not sure what type a value has
        - E.g. if you want to check the type of 3, write type(2).
        - Remember: If you want the output printed, you have to use the print() function around it. E.g. print(type(2)).
