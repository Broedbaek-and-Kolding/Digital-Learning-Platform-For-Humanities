    A value is one of the basic things a programme works with, like a letter or a number. Some examples of values are 3, 53.4, and ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù 

    These values belong to different *types*: 
    - 3 is an *integer*
    - 53.4 is a *floating-point number* 
    - ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù is a *string* 

    There are many types in Python, as you can see from the image below. For now, we will focus on integers, floating-point numbers and strings.

        When you write numbers, like 3 and 53.4, in quotation marks, Python reads them as strings (i.e., the str type). 
        
        Basically, everything you put into quotation marks will be read as strings by Python - even variables that look like numbers!
