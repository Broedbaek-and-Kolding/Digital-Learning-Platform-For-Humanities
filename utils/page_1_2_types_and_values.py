    A value is one of the basic things a programme works with, like a letter or a number. Some examples of values are 2, 42.0, and ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù 

    These values belong to different types: 
    - 2 is an *integer*
    - 42.0 is a *floating-point number* 
    - ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù is a *string* 

    If you are not sure what type a value has, the code windows can tell you. You just have to write type() and then the value whose type you want to check inside the parentheses, e.g. if you want to check the type of 2, write type(2).

    For example, try to check the types of 2, 42.0 and ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù, in the code window below. \n
    Remember: In order to see the output, you have to use the print function.
