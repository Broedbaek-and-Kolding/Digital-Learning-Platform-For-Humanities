    A *value* is one of the basic things a programme works with, like a letter or a number. Some examples of values are 3, 53.4, and ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù 

    These values belong to different *types*: 
    - 3 is an *integer*
    - 53.4 is a *floating-point number* (otherwise known as decimal numbers)
    - ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù is a *string* 

    There are many types in Python, as you can see from the image below. For now, we will focus on integers, floating-point numbers and strings.

    If you are not sure what type a value has, you can find out easily. You just have to use the type function, and then the value whose type you want to check inside the brackets. \n
    E.g. if you want to check the type of 3, write type(3).
    
    The output of the type() function looks something like: <class "int">, <class "str">, or <class "float">.
    
    *Class* is used here in the sense of a category; a type is a category of values. 
    
    The next part of the output refers to the type of the value you are checking. Not surprisingly, integers, such as 3, belong to the type *int*, strings, such as "hello!", belong to *str*, and floating-point numbers, such as 53.4, belong to *float*.
