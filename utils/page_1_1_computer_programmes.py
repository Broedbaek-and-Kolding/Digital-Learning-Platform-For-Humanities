    There are hundreds of different programming languages, which can seem confusing. In this course, we will focus on the language Python.
    
    In Python, every line of code tells the computer to do something. When we have a document full of code lines, we call it a script. Each script is designed to carry out a job, just like a recipe. 

    **Code Editors** \n
    Throughout this course, there will be exercises to get you started coding. One of the best ways to learn how to code is simply to do it: get it through your hands.  

    Below, you see a code editor that says ‚ÄúWrite code here‚Äù. This editor runs Python code, when you press the APPLY button just below the editor, or CMD+ENTER / CTRL+ENTER. \n
    One thing to know about Python is that nothing is returned unless you print it. Therefore, in these simple scenarios that we will practice, you need to use the print() function.

    Try to write a calculation in the code editor below, e.g., 4+4. What do you get as output?
