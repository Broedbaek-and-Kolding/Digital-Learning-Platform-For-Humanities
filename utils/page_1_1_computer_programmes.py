    A *programme* is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. 
    The computation might be something mathematical, like solving an equation, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document, or something graphical, like processing an image or playing a video. 

    The details of how to write a programme look different in every programming language, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language: 

    *Input:* 
    - What the data is and where to get it form, e.g. from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some oher device.

    *Output:* 
    - What to do with the data, e.g. display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc. 

    *Math:* 
    - What basic mathematical operations to perform, like addition and multiplication.

    *Conditional Execution:* 
    - What conditions to check for to run the appropriate code. E.g. should the operations only be performed if the data has certain properties?

    *Repetition:* 
    - Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

    Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every programme you've have used, such as mobile apps or computer games, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that similar to these. 
    You can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.

    There are hundreds of different programming languages, which can seem confusing. In this course, we will focus on the language Python.
    Python is a general-purpose language well-suited for many applications, with simple and naturalistic syntax (i.e., "grammar").
    It is considered easy to use and appropriate for introductory programming.
    Additionally, Python is free and open source, which means that new modules and functionalities are continuously developed and released.
    
    In Python, every line of code tells the computer to do something. When we have a document full of lines of code, we call it a *script*. 
    Each script is designed to carry out a job, just like a recipe. And just like a recipe, all steps are important and must be written out specifically - and in the right order. If all steps are written correctly, it can be followed precisely, step by step, to get the the output we want.

    Throughout this course, there will be exercises to get you started with programming. One of the best ways to learn how to program is simply to do it and practice.  

    Below, you see a code editor that says ‚ÄúWrite code here‚Äù. This editor runs Python code, when you press the APPLY button just below the editor, or CMD+ENTER / CTRL+ENTER. \n
    
    One thing to know about Python is that nothing is returned unless you "print" it. Therefore, in these simple scenarios that we will practice, you need to use the print() function. 
    
    
    "What is a function?", you might ask. A *function* can be thought of as little machines, which you can put something into. Then, they manipulate the input in some way, and, maybe, returns an output. 

    For instance , the print function is used to display messages on the screen. It is called by giving the name of the function, print, followed by a 
    pair of parentheses (brackets) which contain the parameters you want to pass to it. On the image below, the string "hello world" is the parameter.

    st.write('''
    When you use the print function, the parameter you write inside the brackets are the *input*; it is what you put into the function. 
    The *output* is the printed text. E.g., from the image above, the input is "hello world", and the output will be these words printed under "Output of code".
