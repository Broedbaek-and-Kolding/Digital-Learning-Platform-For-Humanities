    By themselves, computers don‚Äôt know how to do anything. So, in order for the computer to do what we want them to, we must give them the right instructions. You can think of it like following a recipe: The computer follows the instructions step-by-step to get the outcome we want. 
    
    Much like learning to read, coding can feel hard to learn. The first time you try to code you will, probably, find it difficult, but every time you do it you get better.

    **Natural languages and formal languages** \n
    When giving instructions to the computer, we want to speak a language it understands. In relation to this, it can be useful to discriminate between natural language and formal language. 

    *Natural languages* 
    - are the languages people speak, such as English and Danish. 
    - These languages developed naturally. 

    *Formal languages*
    - are designed for specific applications. 
    - For instance, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. 
    
    Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express the computations we want the computer to execute. These languages have strict syntax rules that govern the structure of statements; a kind of grammar. E.g. in mathematics, the statement 3+3=6 follows the correct syntax, while 3+ = 3$6 does not. 

    So, programming languages are a kind of formal language, which we can use to get the computer to behave like we want it to. Unlike when we use natural language to communicate with people, we must tell the computer exactly what to do using a formal language. If you tell a computer to start counting upwards, and don't tell it to stop, it'll keep counting forever! Being a good programmer is all about knowing how to tell a computer to act. (Buckley)

    There are hundreds of different programming languages, which can seem confusing. In this course, we will focus on the language Python.

    In Python, every line of code tells the computer to do something. When we have a document full of code lines, we call it a script. Each script is designed to carry out a job, just like a recipe. 

    **Code Windows** \n
    Throughout this course, there will be exercises to get you started coding. One of the best ways to learn how to code is simply to do it: get it through your hands.  

    Below, you see a box that says ‚ÄúWrite code here‚Äù. This box runs Python code, when you press the APPLY button just below the box, or CMD+ENTER. \n
    One thing to know about Python is that nothing is returned under ‚ÄúOutput of code:‚Äù unless you print it. 

    Try to write a calculation below, such as 4+4. What do you get as output? 
    
    Now, try writing print(4+4). Do you get an output now?

                    E.g.  if you write print(4+4), you the output will be 8.
